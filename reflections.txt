A new skill I have learned is how to look at the web/websites as boxes in order to simplify creating mockups. This has helped me understand the term “white boarding” better and I think it is useful to look at designing websites piece by piece or box by box. 
It has been fairly easy so far, as I am familiar with majority of the HTML syntax we have covered so far. I had difficulty with the figures quiz, I couldn’t come up with the correct code so that was a little challenging. 
My problem solving strategies have relied heavily on researching the suggested websites and trying to figure out my mistakes. I have gone to the forum to post a question but ended up finding the answer along the way.
